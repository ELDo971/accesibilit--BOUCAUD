    <h1> 2024 Car livery (personal) standing </h1>
    <h2>1.Ferrari</h2>
    <p>Ferrari's decision to deepen their iconic red is a masterstroke. The richer shade adds a touch of sophistication and power to the car's overall presence. It's a subtle change, but it perfectly captures the essence of the Ferrari brand: classic yet always evolving.</p>

    <h2>2.Aston</h2>
    <p>Aston Martin's livery strikes a perfect balance between elegance and excitement. The classic pairing of British racing green and black exudes sophistication, while the pop of yellow adds a touch of playfulness.</p>

    <h2>3.Williams</h2>
    <p>Williams' new livery is a breath of fresh air! The use of a multi-hued blue melange is truly inspired. The different shades work together beautifully, creating a sense of depth and harmony. This design stands out for its creativity and moves away from the more traditional color schemes on the grid.</p>

    <h2>4.Mercedes</h2>
    <p>Mercedes' approach to their livery is certainly unique. The classic black and silver combination remains the foundation, but the addition of a turquoise line adds a touch of modern flair. While some might find this mix unexpected, it's interesting to see a team experiment with subtle pops of color</p>

    <h2>5.RedBull</h2>
    <p>Red Bull's decision to stick with their familiar livery this season feels like a missed opportunity. While consistency can be valuable, a lack of change can also appear uninspired. Formula 1 thrives on innovation, not just on the track, but also in design.  Fans might have appreciated a fresh take or a subtle evolution of their established theme.</p>

    <h2>6.Mclaren</h2>
    <p>McLaren's return to their classic orange is a definite win. The vibrant color pops and evokes the team's rich history. However, the black accents feel like a bit of a missed opportunity. While the nod to the iconic Marlboro livery is appreciated, the orange and black combination doesn't quite gel as seamlessly as it could.</p>

    <h2>7.Visa CashApp RB</h2>
    <p>While the blue is undeniably beautiful, the white accents leave something to be desired. Their placement feels a bit off, and they don't quite complement the dominant blue as well as they could. Perhaps a different white distribution or a complementary color could have elevated the design even further.</p>

    <h2>8.Alpine</h2>
    <p>Alpine's new car boasts a predominantly black design. While weight reduction is crucial in Formula 1, it shouldn't come at the expense of aesthetics. The lack of color feels bland and doesn't reflect the usual vibrancy of the Alpine brand. Even with weight constraints, surely a more creative color scheme could have been achieved.</p>

    <h2>9.Hass</h2>
    <p>The recent Haas livery update feels a bit off balance. While black can look sleek and powerful, there's just too much of it dominating the car. The previous white sections provided a nice contrast and made the design more visually appealing. </p>

    <h2>10.Stake Sauber</h2>
    <p>In the world of Formula 1, new sponsors often bring new colors to a team's livery. While embracing change is important, the recent addition of flashy green just doesn't work. It's too loud and clashes with the overall aesthetic. Its ugly</p>
